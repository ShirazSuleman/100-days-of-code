# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Sept 04, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through week 5, part 1 videos for Algorithms Part 1 Course on Coursera

**Thoughts** I've realised it's better to stick to only spending 1 hour, at a time, on these tough coding tasks.

### Day 2: Sept 05, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through week 5, part 2 videos for Algorithms Part 1 Course on Coursera

**Thoughts** Enjoying working on coding tasks for just 1 hour each day as it's slow progress, putting one foot ahead of the other.
